# Bill Tracker
This is a short project to help me understand React.js much better.<br>
This project will allow us to know what days bills are paid on, and affect our set monthly balances.<br>
For every bill, that amount is taken away from the holder on that date.<br>

# To Run
    - npm install
    - npm start

# Recent Implementations
    - Scroll to Table onClick



# What I'm Learning
    - Using "props" more effectively
    - Better usage of Components
    - Mounting / Unmounting

My goal is to make this as responsive as possible, and have very quick and effective loading times. Creating new instances of a Component rather than rendering completely new ones. Better use of class structure.
